       Change Charity Movement was founded on 17th June, 2013 by some teenagers wanting to put smiles on the faces of children that are not as privileged as them. Our first project was on 28th December, 2013. 
    </p>
    <p id="hmm" >
       We had a Christmas party for an orphanage to make the children happy and also realize that there are people out there who care. It was fun and exciting. We were able to spend time with the kids; we played games ate and basically enjoyed ourselves. Going home that day after everything had ended, I felt that all of us there had this inner satisfaction for the fact that we had been able to make some kids happy and given back something to the society that raised us. We may be young, but we feel we must go out there and do what we can.
    </p>
    <p id="text_justify">
   The next year, we wanted to add something more to it. So we came up with the idea of organizing a festival of nine lessons and carols for children in the Royal Seed Home aside from a Christmas party. We spent hours with the kids each day during their free after school hours teaching them carols and bible passages to read at the event. We had a wonderful time during that period. We also donated some items to the orphanage and they gave us a huge surprise by giving us a little token of appreciation.
